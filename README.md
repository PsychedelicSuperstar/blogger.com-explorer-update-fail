# blogger.com-explorer-update-fail
so the prior coding isn't accessible on the site but there's an edit template option where i was allowed to paste this update for all internet explorer files but it gave the error code. anyone have any ideas on how to fix up good ol blogger.com? i'm attempting to upload a screenshot of what's happening. the update code is below.
